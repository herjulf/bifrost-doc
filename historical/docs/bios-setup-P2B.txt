Bifrost - Preferred Setup of BIOS (rev 1006) on ASUS P2B
--------------------------------------------------------

Set a passord to protect the BIOS setup. It's not fool proof
because of possible backdoor passords, but will prevent a
clueless person from fiddling with the BIOS. You should anyway
make sure to lock up your routers, firewalls and such in a
secured room.
