100G test system
-----------------
Thanks to Andres Lindfors at Nextron Sweden and Supermicro NL/USA. For 
giving us access to this system for test. We had for access for about 
one month.


System
------
1 x SYS-5018GR-T ( GPU system )
    https://www.supermicro.nl/products/system/1u/5018/sys-5018gr-t.cfm
1 x Intel Xeon E5 8-Core - E5-2620v4, 2.10GHz 20MB LGA 2011 8.0GT/s 85W
http://ark.intel.com/products/92986/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-v4-20M-Cache-2_10-GHz
4 x Micron 4GB DDR4 2133MHz 1Gx4 ECC/Reg 1.2V
    Totalt 16GB i 2133MHz max enligt processor specifikation.
1 x Samsung 120GB SM863 SSD SATA 6Gbps
    http://www.samsung.com/us/business/computing/solid-state-drives/MZ-7KM120E
1 x Supermicro 2.5 inch HDD to SSD adapter tray for 4th Gen. Supermicro server.

NIC
---
1 x Mellanox ConnectXÂ®-4 Single-Port Adapter supporting 100Gb/s with VPI
1 x Mellanox Active fiber cable 3M QSFP



Mid-Range
---------
XEON Quad Core E5620 2.4 GHz 8M L3 Cache QI=5.86GT
TYAN motherboard S7002
3 1GB ECC DDR3 1333MHz
3U Chassies

High-Range
----------
Also a similar system as above but based on 
TYAN's motherboard S7025 

Low-Range and Low Power
-----------------------
ATOM based SuperMicro motherboard X7SPA and variants
Fanless chassies still need some work but there are
some work in progress.

Network Cards
-------------
Intel Network Cards based on:
Chip 82599 for 10g -- ixgbe driver
Chip 82575/6 and 82580 (rel. new and under field test) -- igb driver

Option:
Redundant power supply
 EMACS MRG-6500P Redundant PSU 2x500W


Note!
Memory configuration impacts performance in various ways. If possible use at
least 2 DIMM's per physical CPU to achieve 128 bit transfer mode.
